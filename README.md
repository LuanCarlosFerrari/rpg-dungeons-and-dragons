[Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) a java based implementation using swing.

> Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game. D&D assigns each player a specific character to play. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while also maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur and playing the role of the inhabitants. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants (and each other). Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points to become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.
